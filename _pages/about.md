I am an **AI Researcher** at **Sirjan University of Technology**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **3D perception (point clouds)** and **Green AI**.

---

## Research

- **Robust 3D perception** — efficient, geometry-aware deep learning for point-cloud classification, segmentation, and 3D detection.
- **Adversarial perception security** — analyzing and defending against realistic (including physical-world) attacks that cause perception failures.
- **Secure autonomous systems** — bridging ML threat models and real deployment risks in safety-critical autonomy stacks.

---

## Current focus

I develop **Efficient 3D Deep Learning Models** and **Practical Evaluation and Defense Methods** to improve the robustness and reliability of perception systems under diverse environmental conditions and adversarial perturbations.

I’m open to collaborations on **3D perception**, **adversarial robustness**, and **security for autonomous platforms**.
